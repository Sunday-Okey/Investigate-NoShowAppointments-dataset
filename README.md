# Investigate-NoShowAppointments-dataset
Why this Project?

In this project, I'll go through the data analysis process and see how everything fits together.
I'll use the Python libraries NumPy, pandas, and Matplotlib, which make writing data analysis code in Python a lot easier! Not only that, these are sought-after skills by employers!  

hat will I learn? After completing the project, I will have come away with the following skills: 

- Know all the steps involved in a typical data analysis process.
- Be comfortable posing questions that can be answered with a given dataset and then answering those questions.
- Know how to investigate problems in a dataset and wrangle the data into a format that can be used to produce stunning and interesting analysis and vizualizations.
- Have experience communicating the results of the analysis.
- Be able to use vectorized operations in NumPy and Pandas to speed up data analysis process.
- Be familiar with pandas' Series and DataFrame objects, which let us access data more conveniently
- Know how to use Matplotlib to produce plots showing my findings

## Introduction
For this project, I will conduct data analysis and create a file to share that my findings. I will start by taking a look at a dataset and brainstorming what questions I could answer using it. Then I will use pandas and NumPy to answer the questions I am most interested in, and create a report sharing the answers.
